<p>Trace each brioche ridge in Tideways and discover that each slips between strands of this sinuous braid cable. The dramatic ebb and flow of fabric is formed by just two deceptively simple cable crosses.</p>

<p>This scarf is worked flat, repeating a simple cable chart up to the desired length. The cable pattern is provided in both written and charted form.</p>

<p><strong>Skill Level</strong><br>
Appropriate for a knitter who is proficient in basic cable knitting and curious to try brioche, or vice versa</p>
