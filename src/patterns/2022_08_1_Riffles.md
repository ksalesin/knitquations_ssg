<p>The riffles of a stream burble, tinkle, and splash over jumbled rocks to create a wrinkled fabric of water, just as the twisty cables sprinkled throughout the Riffles Hat slide over smooth runs of ribbing.</p>

<p>The hat is worked circularly from the bottom up, first working a fold-up ribbed brim, then a cable chart that seamlessly transitions into the crown. The cable pattern is provided in charted form only.</p>

<em>Optional: rib cabled cast on (instructions provided), making a pom pom (instructions provided)</em></p>

48 stitches & 42 rows per 4” x 4”/10 cm x 10 cm in twisted rib (unstretched), after blocking</p>

One 16”/40 cm circular needle and one set of double-pointed needles (DPNs) in size needed to obtain gauge listed<br>
Suggested Size: 2.75 mm (US 2)</p>

<p><strong>Dimensions</strong><br>
16”/41 cm circumference and 10.5”/27 cm long, unfolded, after blocking<br>
